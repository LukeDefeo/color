# thi.ng/color

Cross-platform CLJ/CLJS library for color conversion & manipulation
(RGB/RGBA/HSV/CYMK/CIE1931). Also includes a namespace of color
presets (incl. CSS named colors, D3 & Brewer categorical color
schemes).

*Note:* This library relies on the new conditional reader syntax of
 recent Clojure & Clojurescript versions and therefore is **not
 compatible with Clojure versions < 1.7.0**

Please see [index.org](src/index.org) for further information.
